# Portfolio - Three.js & Responsive Demo

Mostly comes from tutorial: [https://youtu.be/aZZrEE_UsIk](https://youtu.be/aZZrEE_UsIk)<br/>
First time encountering Three.js & Responsive component(and I like it!). I learned more about mobile responsiveness and intend to use it in my next project. 

A demo without Resume downloadable as .pdf & Email Confirmation but with responsive mobile landscape.
DEMO: [https://portfolio-magic-gold.vercel.app/](https://portfolio-magic-gold.vercel.app/)

My adjustments: 

- Resume downloadable as .pdf. 
- A tweak to useScreenSize hook to include the height of the screen. Intended for mobile landscape. 
- Improved Email Format Validation
